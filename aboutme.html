<h2>Education</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            I did not receive a formal education. I was raised in the Underground city after my mother's death and was taught survival skills, including knife skills and violence, by his uncle Kenny. Levi primarily learned how to survive and fight through practical experience, rather than traditional education.
